<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

Head in hand, I look at the paper leaf;<br>
It is still white.<br>
<br>
I look at the ink<br>
Dry on the end of my brush.<br>
<br>
My soul sleeps.<br>
Will it ever wake?<br>
<br>
I walk a little in the pouring of the sun<br>
And pass my hands over the higher flowers.<br>
<br>
There is the soft green forest,<br>
There are the sweet lines of the mountains<br>
Carved with snow, red in the sunlight.<br>
<br>
I see the slow march of the clouds,<br>
I hear the crows jeering, and I come back<br>
<br>
To sit and look at the paper leaf,<br>
Which is still white<br>
Under my brush.<br>
<br>

(BALLADE BY NUR UDDIN)<br>
<br>
I have seen a small proud face brimming with sunlight;<br>
I have seen the daughter of the King of Qulzum passing from grace to grace.<br>
Yesterday she threw her bed on the floor of her double house<br>
And laughed with a thousand graces.<br>
She has a little pearl and coral cap<br>
And rides in a palanquin with servants about her<br>
And claps her hands, being too proud to call.<br>
I have seen a small proud face brimming with sunlight.<br>
<br>
"My palanquin is truly green and blue;<br>
I fill the world with pomp and take my pleasure;<br>
I make men run up and down before me,<br>
And am not as young a girl as you pretend.<br>
I am of Iran, of a powerful house, I am pure steel.<br>
I hear that I am spoken of in Lahore."<br>
I have seen a small proud face brimming with sunlight.<br>
<br>
I also hear that they speak of you in Lahore,<br>
You walk with a joyous step,<br>
Your nails are red and the palms of your hands are rosy.<br>
A pear-tree with a fresh stem is in your palace gardens,<br>
I would not that your mother should give my pear-tree<br>
To twine with an evil spice-tree or fool banana.<br>
I have seen a small proud face brimming with sunlight.<br>
<br>
"The coins that my father gave me for my forehead<br>
Throw rays and light the hearts of far men;<br>
The ray of light from my red ring is sharper than a diamond.<br>
I go about and about in pride as of hemp wine<br>
And my words are chosen.<br>
But I give you my honey cheeks, dear, I trust them to you."<br>
I have seen a small proud face brimming with sunlight.<br>
<br>
The words of my mouth are coloured and shining things;<br>
And two great saints are my perpetual guards.<br>
There is never a song of <i>Nur Uddin</i> but has in it a great achievement<br>
And is as brilliant as a young hyacinth;<br>
I pour a ray of honey on my disciples,<br>
There is as it were a fire in my ballades.<br>
I have seen a small proud face brimming with sunlight.<br>

Come, my beloved! And I say again: Come, my beloved!<br>
The doves are moaning and calling and will not cease.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Come, my beloved!<br>
<br>
"The fairies have made me queen, and my heart is love.<br>
Sweeter than the green cane is my red mouth."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Come, my beloved!<br>
<br>
The jacinth has spilled odour on your hair,<br>
The balance of your neck is like a jacinth;<br>
You have set a star of green between your brows.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Come, my beloved!<br>
<br>
Like lemon-trees among the rocks of grey hills<br>
Are the soft colours of the airy veil<br>
To your rose knee from your curved almond waist.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Come, my beloved!<br>
<br>
Your light breast veil is tawny brown with stags,<br>
Stags with eyes of emerald, hunted by red kings.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Come, my beloved!<br>
<br>
<i>Muhammad Din</i> is wandering; he is drunken and mad;<br>
For a year he has been dying. Send for the doctor!<br>

She has put on her green robe, she has put on her double veil, my idol;<br>
My idol has come to me.<br>
She has put on her green robe, my love is a laughing flower;<br>
Gently, gently she comes, she is a young rose, she has come out of the garden.<br>
<br>
Gently she has shown her face, parting her veil, my idol;<br>
My idol has come to me.<br>
She has put on her green robe, my love is a young rose for me to break.<br>
Her chin has the smooth colour of peaches and she guards it well;<br>
She is the daughter of a Moghol house and well they guard her.<br>
<br>
She put on her red jewels when she came with a noise of rings, my idol;<br>
My idol has come to me.<br>
She has put on her green robe, my love is the stem of a rose;<br>
She breaks not, she is strong.<br>
She has a throne, but comes into the woods for love.<br>
<br>
I was well and she troubled me when she came to me in the evening, my idol;<br>
My idol has come to me.<br>
She has put on her green robe, her wrist is a sword.<br>
The villages speak of her; the child is as fair as Badri.<br>
She has red lips and six hundred and fifty beads upon her light blue scarf.<br>
Give your garland to <i>Muhammad Khan</i>, my idol;<br>
My idol has come to me.<br>

<h5><a name="Ghazal_of_Tavakkul"></a>GHAZAL OF TAVAKKUL</h5>

To-day I saw Laila's breasts, the hills of a fair city<br>
From which my heart might leap to heaven.<br>
<br>
Her breasts are a garden of white roses<br>
Having two drifted hills of fallen rose-leaves.<br>
<br>
Her breasts are a garden where doves are singing<br>
And doves are moaning with arrows because of her.<br>
<br>
All her body is a flower and her face is <a href="#Note_Shalibagh">Shalibagh</a>;<br>
She has fruits of beautiful colours and the doves abide there.<br>
<br>
Over the garden of her breasts she combs the gold rain of her hair....<br>
You have killed <i>Tavakkul</i>, the faithful pupil of <a href="#Note_Abdel_Qadir_Gilani">Abdel Qadir Gilani</a>.<br>

<h5><a name="Ghazal_of_Sayyid_Kamal"></a>GHAZAL OF SAYYID KAMAL</h5>

I am burning, I am crumbled into powder,<br>
I stand to the lips in a tossing sea of tears.<br>
<br>
Like a stone falling in Hamun lake I vanish;<br>
I return no more, I am counted among the dead.<br>
<br>
I am consumed like yellow straw on red flames;<br>
You have drawn a poisoned sword along my throat to-day.<br>
<br>
People have come to see me from far towns,<br>
Great and small, arriving with bare heads,<br>
For I have become one of the great historical lovers.<br>
<br>
In the desire of your red lips<br>
My heart has become a red kiln, like a terrace of roses.<br>
It is because she does not trouble about the bee on the rose<br>
That my heart is taken.<br>
<br>
"I have blackened my eyes to kill you, <i>Sayyid Kamal</i>.<br>
I kill you with my eyelids; I am Natarsa, the Panjabie, the pitiless."<br>

<h5><a name="Ghazal_of_Sayyid_Ahmad"></a>GHAZAL OF SAYYID AHMAD</h5>

My heart is torn by the tyranny of women very quietly;<br>
Day and night my tears are wearing away my cheeks very quietly.<br>
<br>
Life is a red thing like the sun setting very quietly;<br>
Setting quickly and heavily and very quietly.<br>
<br>
If you are to buy heaven by a good deed, to-day the market is open;<br>
To-morrow is a day when no man buys,<br>
And the caravan is broken up very quietly.<br>
<br>
The kings are laughing and the slaves are laughing; but for your sake<br>
<i>Sayyid Ahmad</i> is walking and mourning very quietly.<br>

The season of parting has come up with the wind;<br>
My girl has hollowed my heart with the hot iron of separation.<br>
<br>
Keep away, doctor, your roots and your knives are useless.<br>
None ever cured the ills of the ill of separation.<br>
<br>
There is no one near me noble enough to be told;<br>
I tear my collar in the "Alas! Alas!" of separation.<br>
<br>
She was a branch of santal; she closed her eyes and left me.<br>
Autumn has come and she has gone, broken to pieces in the wind of separation.<br>
<br>
I am <i>Pir Muhammad</i> and I am stumbling away to die;<br>
She stamped on my eyes with the foot of separation.<br>

Come in haste this dusk, dear child. I will be on the water path<br>
When your girl friends go laughing by the road.<br>
"Come in haste this dusk; I have become your nightingale,<br>
And the young girls leave me alone because of you.<br>
I give you the poppy of my mouth and my fallen hair."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Come in haste this dusk, dear child.<br>
<br>
"I have dishevelled and spread out my hair for you;<br>
Take my wrist, for there is no shame<br>
And my father has gone out.<br>
Sit near me on this red bed quietly."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Come in haste this dusk, dear child.<br>
<br>
"Sit near me on this red bed, I lift the poppy to your lips;<br>
Your hand is strong upon my breast;<br>
My beauty is a garden and you the bird in the flowering tree."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Come in haste this dusk, dear child.<br>
<br>
"My beauty is a garden with crimson flowers."<br>
But I cannot reach over the thicket of your hair.<br>
This is <i>Nurshali</i> sighing for the garden;<br>

And pierced a brass hill for the love of Shirin.<br>
The world is fainting,<br>

Qutab Khan of the Ranizais was in love<br>
And death became the hostess of his lady.<br>
The world is fainting,<br>
And you will weep at last.<br>

Adam loved Durkho, and they were separated.<br>
You know the story;<br>
There is no lasting love.<br>
The world is fainting,<br>
And you will weep at last.<br>

This is a moment to be generous.<br>

Old bamboos are about my house,<br>
And the floor of my house is untidy with old books.<br>

And read the poems of the masters.<br>

But I remember a delightful fisherman<br>
Who played on the five-stringed dan in the evening.<br>
In the day he allowed his reed canoe to float<br>
Over the lakes and rivers,<br>
Watching his nets and singing.<br>

Her hands are filled with what I lack,<br>
And on her arms are pictures,<br>
Looking like files of ants forsaking the battalions,<br>
Or hail inlaid by broken clouds on green lawns.<br>
<br>
She fears the arrows of her proper eyes<br>
And has her hands in armour.<br>
<br>
She has stretched her hands in a cup to me,<br>
Begging for my heart.<br>
She has circled me with the black magic of her brows<br>
And shot small arrows at me.<br>
<br>
The black curl that lies upon her temple<br>
Is a scorpion pointing his needle at the stars.<br>
<br>
Her eyes seem tight, tight shut;<br>
But I believe she is awake.<br>

The poets have muddied all the little fountains.<br>
<br>
Yet do not my strong eyes know you, far house?<br>
<br>
O dwelling of Abla in the valley of Gawa,<br>
Speak to me, for my camel and I salute you.<br>
<br>
My camel is as tall as a tower, and I make him stand<br>
And give my aching heart to the wind of the desert.<br>
<br>
O erstwhile dwelling of Abla in the valley of Gawa;<br>
And my tribe in the valleys of Hazn and Samna<br>
And in the valley of Motethalem!<br>
<br>
Salute to the old ruins, the lonely ruins<br>
Since Oum El Aythan gathered and went away.<br>
<br>
Now is the dwelling of Abla<br>
In a valley of men who roar like lions.<br>
It will be hard to come to you, O daughter of Makhram.<br>

Abla is a green rush<br>
That feeds beside the water.<br>
<br>
But they have taken her to Oneiza<br>
And my tribe feeds in lazy Ghailam valley.<br>
<br>
They fixed the going, and the camels<br>
Waked in the night and evilly prepared.<br>
<br>
I was afraid when I saw the camels<br>
Standing ready among the tents<br>
And eating grain to make them swift.<br>
<br>
I counted forty-two milk camels,<br>
Black as the wings of a black crow.<br>
<br>
White and purple are the lilies of the valley,<br>
But Abla is a branch of flowers.<br>
<br>
Who will guide me to the dwelling of Abla?<br>

Rise and hold up the curved glass,<br>
And pour us wine of the morning, of El Andar.<br>

Pour wine for us, whose golden colour<br>
Is like a water stream kissing flowers of saffron.<br>

Pour us wine to make us generous<br>
And carelessly happy in the old way.<br>

Pour us wine that gives the miser<br>
A sumptuous generosity and disregard.<br>

When it should have been moving to the right;<br>
And yet the one of us three that you would not serve<br>
Is not the least worthy.<br>

By herself she is fearless<br>
And gives her arms to the air,<br>
The limbs of a long camel that has not borne.<br>
<br>
She gives the air her breasts,<br>
Unfingered ivory.<br>
<br>
She gives the air her long self and her curved self,<br>
And hips so round and heavy that they are tired.<br>
<br>
All these noble abundances of girlhood<br>
Make the doors divinely narrow and myself insane.<br>
<br>
Columns of marble and ivory in the old way,<br>
And anklets chinking in gold and musical bracelets.<br>
<br>
Without her I am a she-camel that has lost,<br>
And howls in the sand at night.<br>
<br>
Without her I am as sad as an old mother<br>
Hearing of the death of her many sons.<br>

With hot earth-coloured hair,<br>
Who lived with me<br>
And left me.<br>

Flow to my music.<br>

The bracelets on my arms<br>

Melted the snow of parting,<br>

Aischa was mine,<br>
My tender cousin,<br>
My blond lover;<br>
And you knew our love,<br>
Uncle without bowels,<br>
Foul old man.<br>
<br>
For a few weights of gold<br>
You sold her to the blacks,<br>
And they will drive a stinking trade<br>
At the dark market;<br>
Your slender daughter,<br>
The free child of our hills.<br>
<br>
She will go to serve the bed<br>
Of a fat man with no God,<br>
A guts that cannot walk,<br>
A belly hiding his own feet,<br>
A rolling paunch<br>
Between itself and love.<br>
<br>
She was slim and quick<br>
Like the antelope of our hills<br>
When he comes down in the summer-time<br>
To bathe in the pools of Tereck,<br>
Her stainless flesh<br>
Was all moonlight.<br>
<br>
Her long silk hair<br>
Was of so fine a gold<br>
And of so honey-like a brown<br>
That bees flew there,<br>
And her red lips<br>
Were flowers in sunlight.<br>
<br>
She was fair, alas, she was fair,<br>
So that her beauty goes<br>
To a garden of dying flowers,<br>
Made one with the girls that mourn<br>
And wither for light and love<br>
Behind the harem bars.<br>
<br>
And you have dirty dreams<br>
That she will be Sultane,<br>
And you will drink and boast<br>
And roll about,<br>
The grinning ancestor<br>
Of little kings.<br>
<br>
Hugging your very wicked gold<br>
Within a greasy belt,<br>
You paddle exulting like a bald ape<br>
That glories to defile,<br>
Unmindful of two hot young streams<br>
Of tears.<br>
<br>
You stole this dirty gold,<br>
For this gold means<br>
Your daughter's freedom<br>
And your nephew's love,<br>
Two fresh and lovely things<br>
Groaning within your belt.<br>
<br>
The sunny playing of our childhood<br>
At the green foot of Elbours,<br>
The starry playing of our youth<br>
Beyond the flowery fences,<br>
These sigh their lost delights<br>
Within your belt.<br>
<br>
Give me the gold;<br>
Damn you, give me the gold....<br>
You kill my mercy<br>
When you kill my love....<br>
Hold up your trembling sword;<br>
For this is death.<br>

And grasping swords in sleep.<br>
My rifle is as clean as moonlight,<br>
My flints are new;<br>
My long grey sword is sighing<br>
In his blue sheath.<br>
Fatima gave me my grey sword<br>
Of Temrouk steel,<br>
Damascened in red gold<br>
To cut a pathway for the feet of love.<br>
<br>
My eye is dark and keen,<br>
My hand has never trembled on the sword.<br>
If your brothers rise and follow<br>
On their stormy horses,<br>
If they stretch their hot hands<br>
To catch you from my breast,<br>
My rifle shall not sing to them,<br>
My steel shall spare.<br>
My rifle's song is for my yellow girl,<br>
My eye is dark and keen,<br>
I'll send my bullet to the fairest heart<br>
That ever lady loved with in the world.<br>
<br>
My hand upon the sword<br>
Shall be so strong,<br>
He'll find the little laughing place<br>
Where you dance in my breast;<br>
And we'll have no more of the silly world<br>
Where our lips must lie apart.<br>
We'll let death pour our souls<br>
Into one cup,<br>
And mount like joyous birds to God<br>
With hearts on fire,<br>
And God will mingle us into one shape<br>

What by the freshness of those blue streams,<br>
Seeing my face reflected there alone?<br>

For all of Allah's Chosen would desire you.<br>
And if Mahomet threw his handkerchief<br>
And took you up and loved you for himself?<br>

Eyes of my eyes, how could I then defend you?<br>
I could not be at ease and watch him love you;<br>
And if I mutinied against the Prophet,<br>
He, being zealous to love you in his peace,<br>
<br>
Would rise and send me hurrying<br>
Back by the sword-blade thinness of the bridge<br>
From paradise to earth, and in the middle<br>
Flick me down sideways to the fires of hell.<br>

My skin would cook and be renewed for ever<br>
Where murderers were burning and renewing;<br>
And evil souls, my only crime being love,<br>
Would burn me and annoy me and destroy me.<br>

I could not even make my prayer to Allah<br>
That in his justice he should give me back<br>
My paradise.<br>

<h2><a name="Translators_Notes"></a>TRANSLATOR'S NOTES</h2>


THE GARDEN OF BRIGHT WATERS

<p>I am hoping that some readers will look on this collection primarily as
a book of poems. The finding and selection of material and the shaping
of the verses is my principal part in it. Most of the songs have been
written from, or by comparing, the literal translations of French and
Italian scholars, checked wherever possible by my own knowledge. When my
first and very great debt to these has been stated, there remains my
debt to the late John Duncan, to Mr. J. Wing, and to a friend, a
distinguished writer both in Persian and Turkish, who wishes to remain
unnamed. The kindness of these writers lies in trusting their work to my
translation and helping me in that task. My book also owes much to
suggestions prompted by the wide learning of Mr. L. Cranmer-Byng. My
final debt is to him and to another generous critic. I have arranged my
poems in the alphabetical order of their countries, and added short
notes wherever I considered them necessary, at the instance of some
kindly reviewers of an earlier book, which was not so arranged
and provided.</p>

<br><i>AFGHANISTAN</i><br>

<p><a name="Note_Sikander"></a>SIKANDER, Alexander the Great.</p>

<p><a name="Note_Shalibagh"></a>SHALIBAGH, the notable garden of Shalimar in Lahore, planted by Shah
Jahan in 1637.</p>

<p><a name="Note_Abdel_Qadir_Gilani"></a>ABDEL QADIR GILANI, Abd al-Qadir al-Jilani, founder of the Qadirite
order of the Dervishes, twelfth century.</p>

<br><i>ANNAM</i><br>

<p><a name="Note_Kien_Niu"></a>K'IEN NIÜ and CHIK NÜ: the legend of these two stars comes from China
and is told in Japan. Readers are referred to that section of Mr. L.
Cranmer-Byng's <i>A Lute of Jade</i> which deals delightfully with Po-Chü-i;
and to Lafcadio Hearn's <i>Romance of the Milky Way</i>.</p>

<br><i>ARABIC</i><br>

<p><a name="Note_Antar"></a>ANTAR, the hero Antar Ebn Cheddad Ebn Amr Corad, who lived in the late
sixth and early seventh centuries, owes his European reputation to
<i>Siret Antar</i>, the Adventures of Antar, or more exactly the Conduct of
Antar, written by Abul-Moyyed "El Antari" in the twelfth century. This
book tells of the fighter's feats in war and of his love for his cousin
Abla; and these are the themes of Antar's own poems.</p>

<p><a name="Note_Escape"></a>AN ESCAPE: in this poem Abu Nuas, the Court poet, tells of an adventure
of the Khalif Haroun. There is a story that the Khalif, being set back
by the answer of his lady, called his poets in the morning and bade them
write a poem round the phrase, "Words of a night to bring the day." All
were rewarded for their work save Abu Nuas; and he was condemned to
death for spying through keyholes on his master. But after he had proved
an alibi, he also was rewarded.</p>

<p><a name="Note_John_Duncan"></a>"JOHN DUNCAN was a lowland Scot, who lived in Edinburgh until he was
between twenty and twenty-five years old. He was educated at one of the
Scots schools, and knew his way about the University if he was not
actually a student there. He certainly had enough money to live on. A
love affair in which he must have been infamously treated caused him to
leave Scotland. Within a year or two he was an established member of a
small tribe of nomadic Arabs, and eventually he became in speech and
appearance one of them, living their lazy, pastoral life and travelling
up and down with them the whole line of the southwest coast of the
Persian Gulf. Before his death, which occurred last year, at the age of
forty-two or forty-three, he had become acquainted with the whole of
habitable Arabia.</p>

<p>"Let Mr. Mathers take up the story as he told it to me: 'He married an
Arab, and all his forty-odd poems are addressed to her. I saw only a
snapshot of her, which showed her to be beautiful. In her he certainly
found healing for the wound his abnormally fiery and sensitive nature
had taken from the first woman. She pulled together an intellect rather
easily subdued. I only knew him after her death (his reason for
travelling to this country), and a dazed, utterly unpractical and
uninterested habit of mind, which alternated with his brilliance of
speech and to a less degree of thought, was probably a reversion to the
psychic state which his marriage had cured.</p>

<p>" 'Like so many to whom life has at one time given a paralysing shock,
Duncan was extremely reticent, save when he could lead the conversation,
and be confidential at points of his own choosing; and he was not an
easy man to question. The disappointment which had driven him from his
country certainly made him more bitter against the British than any
other man I have listened to. All his considerable wit and the natural
acid of his thought were directed against our ideas, institutions,
and beliefs.</p>

<p>" 'His one sane enthusiasm, English lyric verse, of whose depths,
main-stream, and back-waters his knowledge was profound, formed one-half
of his conversation.</p>

<p>" 'His English in talking was rich and varied, and it was an ironic
caprice which made him refuse to write in that language. I doubt,
though, whether he would have composed with ease in any tongue, for he
found it hard to concentrate, and his small stock of verse was the
outcome of ten years of unoccupied life. He approved, rather mockingly,
my promise to try to find an English equivalent for some of them; and I
think I have copies of all he wrote.</p>

<p>" 'One not acquainted with the man might find them rather hard to render,
as, had he been an Arab actually, still he would have been the most
unconventional of poets, neglecting form and the literary language.'"</p>

<p>My most cordial thanks are due to The Bookworm, of the <i>Weekly
Dispatch</i>, for permission to make this long quotation from an article
headed, "The Strange Story of John Duncan, the Arab-Scot," which
appeared over his <i>nom de plume</i> in the issue of that newspaper for
March 30, 1919.</p>

<br><i>CHINA</i><br>

<p><a name="Note_J_Wing"></a>J. WING: I have already translated three of this writer's poems:
"English Girl," "Climbing after Nectarines," and "Being together at
Night." These may be found in <i>Coloured Stars</i>. Mr. Wing is an
American-born Chinese and practises the profession of a valet.</p>

<br><i>JAPAN</i><br>

<p><a name="Note_Clocks"></a>THE CLOCKS OF DEATH: this poem is a <i>zi-sei</i>, or lyric made at the point
of death. Naga-Haru committed suicide after an unsuccessful defence of
the strong castle Mi-Ki against Hashiba Hideyoshi in 1580. His wife
followed his example, composing this poem as she died.</p>

<p><a name="Note_Wakana"></a>WAKANA, the turnip cabbage, whose leaves are eaten in early spring. The
Mikado is lamenting a sudden realisation that he is too old for
his love.</p>

<p><a name="Note_Cushion"></a>THE CUSHION: the poetess, daughter of Tsu-gu-naka, lord of Su-Wo, while
at a party, asked for a cushion. A certain Iye-tada offered his arm for
her to lean her head against, and she answered with these lines.</p>

<p><a name="Note_Street_Songs"></a>STREET SONGS: the three poems which I have so called are written in
everyday colloquial Japanese. The words of the old language, which are
the ornament of literary verse, are almost entirely excluded from these
songs. In them one finds a superabundance of auxiliaries, and the
presence of these marks a clear line between the literary and the
folk-idiom.</p>

<br><i>KAZACKS</i><br>

<p><a name="Note_Tamour-Leng"></a>TAMOUR-LENG, Tamerlane. The facts of "You Do Not Want Me" are
historical; but it should be added that Gahuan-Beyg succeeded in
overcoming Zohrah's indifference, and that a few months after their
marriage he beheaded her with his own hand for speaking to another man.</p>

<br><i>LAOS</i><br>

<p><a name="Note_Love_Nights"></a>THE LOVE NIGHTS OF LAOS, "Wan-Pak" Nights, at the eighth evening of the
waxing or waning of the moon, when even Buddha has no fault to find with
love-making in the thickets. Songs, of which I have translated three,
are sung on these nights to the accompaniments of the "Khane," a
pan-pipe of seven flutes; some being reserved for the singing of the
wandering bands of girls, and others for answer by the youths.</p>

<br><i>PERSIA</i><br>

<p><a name="Note_Roses"></a>THE ROSES, this rubai made Abu Yshac famous. He died at least twenty
years before the birth of Omar Khayyam. Readers will have been struck by
the similarity of idea in "The Roses" and in two lines in
Fitzgerald's Rubaiyat:</p>

<blockquote>I often wonder what the vintners buy<br>
One-half so precious as the goods they sell.</blockquote>

<br><i>THIBET</i><br>

<p><a name="Note_Archer_Prince"></a>THE LOVE OF THE ARCHER PRINCE: this form of poem, with one rhyme and
repetitive and increasing lines, is a familiar one in Thibet; and thence
it has entered Kafiristan and become a popular manner of composition
Archipelago. English readers will remember an analogous poem, "The House
that Jack built."</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
